### What is React?.
React as the docs says is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Why learning React?

- ### Declarative
  React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each<br> state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the<br> right components when your data changes.<br>

  Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.<br>
  In addition, React declarative nature make it very easy, in sense that, you just tell<br> it what you want and React will effectively do the hard work for you.<br>

- ### Component-Based
  Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.<br>
  Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data <br>through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

## Prerequisites to learn React
- Good Knowledge about HTML and CSS.
- Good understanding of JavaScript basic more importantly ES6 or ECAMScript 6 or ES2016<br> stuff like let, const, arrow function, classes, array methods like map, filter etc.
- Basic knowledge of Node and npm (commands)
